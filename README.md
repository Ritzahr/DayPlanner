A location-based route planning map, which takes into consideration a user's location and shows them nearby tourist hotspots/attractions within their vicinity. 
Users can set the radius within which locations will render in, whilst also being able to sort through a category of amenities displayed.
Route planning is an integral part of the application, enabling users to create a route based off the amenities they choose from, selecting a starting location, additional stops and end point, whilst being able to save their routes for future reusability.
